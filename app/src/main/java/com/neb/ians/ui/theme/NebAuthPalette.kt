// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The palette the sign-in and onboarding journey is set in.
//
// The app proper runs on MaterialTheme. The journey does not: it is the only
// place where every surface, hairline and illustration has to agree pixel for
// pixel, so it carries its own flat palette instead of reaching into the
// colour scheme. Three rules hold it together.
//
//   Paper is the page. The brand blue is the single voice of action — the
//   primary pill, a link, a chosen option, a filled code box. And every
//   illustration is drawn from `artTones`, which is a strictly neutral
//   ink-on-paper ramp with no hue in it at all.
//
// That last rule is deliberate and load-bearing. The art is line drawing: it
// reads as something drawn by hand in ink, and tinting it blue would turn it
// into UI. So the blue lives in `brand`/`accent` and never in `art*`. If you
// are reaching for a colour inside a NebArt composable, reach for `artTones`.
//
// Red survives for errors, because an error that reads as ordinary text is not
// an error.
